# React 3d Animation with three.js and react-three-fiber Library

3D animation is one of many ways that frontend development has evolved over time. They boost user interaction with your website and make it appear as if you're engaging with real-world objects.

## What is three.js?

Three.js is a cross-browser Javascript library that allows you to create and manipulate interactive 2D and 3D graphics animation in your browser using the [HTML5 canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) and [WebGL API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API).

## What is react-three-fiber?

`react-three-fiber` is an open-source react-renderer for three.js. It makes it easier to use three.js in React by exposing reusable and self-contained components from three.js.
